    <h1>Energy-Efficient Appliances: Saving Money and the Planet</h1>
    
    <div class="summary">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> A comprehensive guide to energy-efficient home appliances, covering selection criteria, efficiency ratings, cost-benefit analysis, and the environmental impact of choosing eco-friendly household devices.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Understanding Energy Efficiency Ratings</h2>
    <p>
        Energy efficiency ratings provide a standardized way to compare the energy consumption of different appliances. In Europe, the energy label system uses a scale from A to G, with A being the most efficient. Other regions use different systems, such as ENERGY STAR in North America, which certifies products that meet specific efficiency criteria.
    </p>
    
    <h2>High-Impact Appliance Categories</h2>
    <p>
        When prioritizing energy-efficient upgrades, focus on the appliances that consume the most energy in the average home: refrigerators and freezers, washing machines and dryers, dishwashers, and HVAC systems. These represent the greatest opportunity for energy and cost savings.
    </p>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Quick Tip:</strong> A modern A-rated refrigerator uses approximately 80% less energy than a similar model from 15 years ago. This can translate to savings of €50-100 per year on electricity bills.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        While energy-efficient appliances often have higher purchase prices, the total cost of ownership (including energy expenses) is typically lower over the appliance's lifetime. For example, an efficient washing machine might cost €100 more upfront but save €30 per year in energy and water costs, paying for itself within 3-4 years.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Smart Features and Energy Management</h2>
    <p>
        Modern energy-efficient appliances increasingly incorporate smart features that further reduce consumption. These include programmable operation during off-peak electricity hours, load sensing in washing machines and dishwashers, and adaptive defrost cycles in refrigerators. Connected appliances can also integrate with home energy management systems to optimize overall household consumption.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond financial savings, energy-efficient appliances significantly reduce environmental impact. The average household that replaces all major appliances with high-efficiency models reduces its carbon footprint by approximately 1.5 tons of CO2 per year—equivalent to removing a typical car from the road for two months.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Disposal and Recycling</h2>
    <p>
        When replacing appliances, proper disposal of old units is essential for environmental protection. Many retailers offer take-back programs, and municipal recycling centers accept appliances. This ensures that refrigerants and other potentially harmful components are safely handled, while recoverable materials are reclaimed.
