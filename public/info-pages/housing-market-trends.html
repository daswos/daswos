    <h1>Housing Market Trends 2025</h1>
    
    <div class="summary">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> Analysis of current housing market trends in 2025, including price developments, interest rates, and predictions for urban vs rural markets. Data shows significant shifts in buyer preferences following workplace flexibility policies.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Market Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The 2025 housing market continues to adapt to the long-term effects of remote work policies. While many had predicted a return to pre-pandemic patterns, the data shows that hybrid work models have created lasting changes in housing preferences and regional demand.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Price Trends</h2>
    <p>
        National average home prices have increased by 4.2% year-over-year, though this masks significant regional variations. Urban centers with strong tech presences have seen increases of up to 7.8%, while some rural areas that benefited from the initial "work from anywhere" movement have seen price stabilization or modest declines.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Interest Rate Impact</h2>
    <p>
        The current interest rate environment has moderated from the peaks of 2023-2024, with 30-year fixed mortgage rates now averaging 5.1%. This decrease has improved affordability somewhat, though rates remain higher than the historical lows seen in 2020-2021.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Regional Spotlights</h2>
    <p>
        Mid-sized cities with strong amenities and quality of life factors continue to outperform, with markets like Raleigh-Durham, Austin, and Boise showing strong demand. A new trend in 2025 is the emergence of "satellite communities" - small towns within 1-2 hours of major metros that offer both proximity to urban centers and more affordable housing options.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
    <p>
        Analysts predict continued moderate growth through 2026, with potential cooling in overheated markets. The most significant factor influencing future trends will be the balance between interest rate policies and housing supply increases, with new construction still struggling to meet demand in many regions.
