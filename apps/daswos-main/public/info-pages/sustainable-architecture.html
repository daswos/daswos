    <h1>Sustainable Architecture: Building for the Future</h1>
    
    <div class="summary">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> An exploration of modern sustainable architecture practices, examining how innovative design, materials, and technologies are helping create environmentally responsible buildings that reduce carbon footprints while enhancing occupant wellbeing.

    <h2>The Evolution of Green Building</h2>
    <p>
        Sustainable architecture has evolved from a niche approach to a mainstream necessity. Today's green buildings go beyond simple energy efficiency to embrace a holistic approach that considers everything from material sourcing and construction methods to operational impacts and end-of-life recycling possibilities.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Principles</h2>
    <p>
        Modern sustainable architecture embraces several core principles: energy efficiency through passive design; renewable energy integration; water conservation and reuse systems; non-toxic, locally-sourced materials; waste reduction strategies; and biophilic elements that connect occupants with nature.
    </p>
    
    <div class="figure">
        The average LEED-certified building uses 25% less energy and 11% less water than a conventional building.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Innovative Materials</h2>
    <p>
        The materials revolution has been central to sustainable architecture's advancement. Cross-laminated timber offers a low-carbon alternative to concrete and steel. Recycled materials, from plastic composite decking to reclaimed wood and metal, reduce waste streams. Meanwhile, living materials like algae panels that generate energy or mycelium-based insulation represent the cutting edge.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Smart Building Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        Digital technology enhances sustainability through building management systems that optimize energy use based on occupancy and external conditions. The integration of IoT sensors allows for real-time adjustments to lighting, heating, cooling, and ventilation, maximizing efficiency while maintaining comfort.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>
        The Edge in Amsterdam has become a benchmark for smart, sustainable commercial buildings, achieving 98% energy efficiency improvement over traditional offices. Meanwhile, Bosco Verticale in Milan demonstrates how even high-density urban buildings can incorporate extensive natural elements, with each tower hosting over 900 trees and thousands of plants.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Future Directions</h2>
    <p>
        The future of sustainable architecture lies in regenerative design that goes beyond minimizing negative impacts to actively improving environmental conditions. Buildings that generate more energy than they consume, purify surrounding air and water, and sequester carbon represent the next frontier in green building.
